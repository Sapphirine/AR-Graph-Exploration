# AR-Graph-Exploration
D1. Network and graph visualizations pose extreme challenges due to the density and interconnectedness of data. Many tools attempt to solve this through intelligent layout and interactivity with limited success. While applying the principles of network/graph layout and interactivity with an immersive environment (AR – Augmented Reality or VR – Virtual reality) we can immerse end users in a much larger set of data while interactively presenting valuable insights.
